                <h4>General Knowledge</h4>
                <p>The advanced tags of HTML build off of the basic ones. They add more onto the decoration of the code, such as shadows, animations, advanced color theories and techniques and include important positioning tags as well, all of which are used across all levels of Computer Science. These tags are more complex but aren't used <i>as</i> much as the basic tags that have already been covered but are still good for doing basic functions in the HTML file without JS or other languages. Colors are still just as important, and come with extra ways to create it instead of typing in a word (RGB and HSl are the most common).</p><br>
                <p>To make the site really stand out you should be using text hiearchies and color palettes that both compliment and contrast with each other, and make sure the titles and subheaders are larger than normal text, such as the "<strong>h4</strong>" above, versus this text. It looks kind of odd when it isnt laid out this way so it is important to keep it in order. You can edit the properties of these tags but it should generally have the same rules despite its properties. Fonts that you use should also be readable, which means a lot more of blocky fonts like Times New Roman, but it is ok to include more fun fonts.</p>
                <p>Frameworks are a library with pre-made code that displays certain things. There are quite a few of these to choose from and they mostly offer simalair things, with minor differences in the code and appearance of the item. For example, the above Navbar was taken from Bootstrap and I edited it so that it would fit the appearance that I wanted. The cards that these notes are taken in was copied from Foundation, which offers more Navigation and buisness components than Bootstrap does. However, the both have their benefits and can obviously be combined to create the best looking site possible. Changing the CSS of these elements are a lot harder as certain CSS code has already been written down in the Framework's CSS file, so you need tags such as "<strong>!important</strong>" or you can go through and edit the specific code, which is much harder. </p>

    <div class= "callout small middle">
      <h4>Positioning</h4>
      <p>Positioning is important on a website so that everything is in a nice and neat order and isnt randomly spread around the page. Some tag elements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <p>The "<strong>relative</strong>" tag can move an element based on its surroudning elements and what they are doing</p>
        <p>The "<strong>abseloute</strong>" tag locks an element in place so that it can't be moved based on user interactions and other things that the develepor might change on the site</p>
        <p>The "<strong>auto</strong>" tag evens out the margin or padding and puts the element in the middle of the page</p>
        <p>The "<strong>float</strong>" tag aligns something to the left, center, and right side and is very useful for pictures</p>
        <p> The "<strong>z-index</strong>" tag moves the element up and down the layering order</p>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class= "container col-lg-6 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
    <div class= "callout small middle">
      <h4>Animation</h4>
      <p>You can animate HTML elements with limited tags that create basic animation features that work on pictures and other objects, not just text. You can assign a class to the animation tag, and you can use Keyframes which are like checkpoints and go from 0-100</p>
      <ul>
        <p>You can use different keyframes and classes to do different things on the same element</p>
        <p>You can use "<strong>animation-iteration</strong>" tag which tells the animation how many times to run</p>
        <p>You can use the "<strong>animation-timing</strong>" tag to tell the animation what it should be doing during its run.<br>(Ex: Have yellow at one point and then switch over to green afterwards)</p>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div class= "row">
  <div class= "container col-lg-6 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
    <div class= "callout small middle">
      <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
      <p>Bootstrap is a popular and easy to learn Framework which offers quite a lot of different components for free. They are all customizable and look nice even if you just copy and paste, with no editing. They also offer Icons that you can use and they support a 12 column system for responsiveness.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Its important to know what you are copying into your IDE and their Docs site usually tells you what the function is or how its made</p>
        <p>There are usually a whole bunch of addons you can slap onto an element to make it better or look slightly different.</p>
        <p>There are also tons of free templates that utilize Bootstrap that you can use to base a site off of, or you can build one up entirely from scratch while only using Bootstrap elements and regular HTML/CSS</p>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <div class= "container col-lg-6 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
    <div class= "callout small middle">
      <h4>Foundation</h4>
      <p>Foundation is another Framework, simalair to Bootstrap. It offers most of the same thing Bootstrap does but offers more pre made components for navigation than Bootstrap does, as mentioned previously. Foundation elements have a much more blocky and older design than Bootstrap does, but can still be customized to get the new look that some people might want.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Foundation also has a Docs page for all of their components and features</p>
        <p>Foundation has a good responsiveness system and is pretty easy and convinent to use</p>
        <p>Foundation also has a few extra fun features that you can hide somewhere in your website, or just use them for a practical purpose.</p>
        <p>Foundation supports images and has an extensive library for code that can display whatever you choose</p>
      </ul>
