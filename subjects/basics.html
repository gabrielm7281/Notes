    <h4>General Knowledge</h4>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the most basic ways you could possibly make a decent functioning website. It is mostly working with the front end of the website (whatever you see and maybe interact with in some cases) so it isnt the most detailed way to build one. You can add on JavaScript to make some features functional and add fancy animations, better than the ones that HTML and CSS can support. You should be combining elements to create the best look for your website, and mess around with pre made code to figure out what it does. This way you can understand what you are putting into your code, giving you the ability to quickly edit out something without searching for its function.</p><br>
    <p>There are a few basic tags that are the basic essentials of a website. They start from Headers, and go down to regular text. These tags are <code class= "language-html">&lt;h1-6&gt; and &lt;p&gt;</code>There are also modifiers to make the text bold, italiziced, underlined, and crossed out. Most of their tags are just their first letter except for the crossed out one, which is <strong>"sr"</strong></p><br>
    <p>CSS is code to make the HTML code look pretty. It has been updated over the years to support borders, fonts and other things involving text, including Line-Height, spacing and alignment. People have also come up with ways to apply this to almsot anything that you can make on a website, not just HTML. It has a heiarchy to be able to decide what it should display when it is viewed. The first things that are typed up are the lowest priority, as it applys whatever it can as it goes down the file. For example, if I wanted to make a sentence red, I could type it out on the CSS file, but if I already had a blue text below the red command, then it would stay blue. There is also a sytem that allows you to pick out the heiarchy, despite its location in the file. These are(In Order): "<strong>!important, Inline, Style, Id and Class</strong>. The class is the lowest in priority and can be selected in the CSS with ".class." The second in priority is the Id, and it is selected with "#id." The third is Style, and this is located at the head of the HTML sheet. It is a place for you to put CSS without making a whole new file for it, and can be easily used for smaller projects that dont need as much designing, or for individual HTML files. The inline command overides everything else and can be made with <code class= "language-html">&lt;p style= "CSS command"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code>. This is for changing CSS on individual lines. The "!important" tag completely overides everything else and isnt used that much. Its best function is to make new CSS that redoes code from another CSS file, which might have thousands of lines of code, like the Bootstrap CSS file.</p>

    <h4>Color Theories and Decorations</h4>
    <p>Colors are very important to a website. There needs to be a good balance between them, and with a small palette of colors including highlighters and contrasting/complimenting colors. They are all important to draw you eyes to things, as well as making it easier to look at as long as the colors aren't too harsh. </p><br>
    <ul>
      <p>To select only one line to change color, start the text with <code class= "language-html">&lt;p style= "color"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
      To select entire text category (h1, h3, li, p), use: h1 {placeholder}<br>
      Hex code counts using a base 16 system instead of a base 10 like normal English. Numbers 0-9 represent themselves in hex but letters A-F  represent the rest of the 16 possible values.
      0 represents the lowest code and shows the least color while F is the brightest (0 is the same in RGB but F is replaced with 255 in RGB)
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <ul><p>To assign a class, use <code class= "language-html">&lt;p class= "Text"&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
      Use a comma when selecting multiple HTML  elements<br>
      Use .class {text} to select elements only with the class of "text" (Replace ".class" with "#id" for an id tag). 3rd in priority when clashing with other CSS elements. You can also use "id.class {text}" to select things with an id <strong>and</strong> a class. 2nd in priority when clashing with other CSS elements
