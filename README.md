# Notes
Notes for me about SEP10 and maybe other classes in the future


Reorganize the structure of the Notes site so that index.html is a central page and the rest of the notes are inside the grades folder. Have folders with grades with SEP10, SEP11, APCSA and Python and the actual notes inside the folder of their year
